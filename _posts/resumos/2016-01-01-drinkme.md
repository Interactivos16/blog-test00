Research how human activity affects the local water eco-system, and create a Text Adventure Game to show interactions between active elements and different processes of causes and effects. The proposal is to research some facet of the environmental impact of the waterways, and create a hyperlinked narrative to create more understanding and empathy about the eco-system for a broader audience, while serving as a kind of interactive documentation about the developments in the Lab.This will include lab experiments with sensors, maybe some networked systems to use real data to inform the questions/decisions in the narrative.
