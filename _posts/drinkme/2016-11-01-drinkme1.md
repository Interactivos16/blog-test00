## Pre-Interactivos?
Arrived at <em>Serrinha</em> via GIG, picked up by Hernâni at <em>Rodoviário Novo Rio</em> then Meire at <em>Resende</em>. The number of new people and language is overwheleming. Still trying to adjust to timezone and the fact that I'm in Brasil. Thiago has a new haircut. I saw a hummingbird. Massa.


## Dia 1 - Domingo
Misty and cold today, everything slightly blurry and can't see mountain range in the background. There is a giant stone pool that will never fill up, decorated with upturned PET bottles. 

Went through presentations of the projects, and people this morning. Radamés translated the projects beforehand but, only had an idea from the title and short discription - in short not much. Now getting an idea of what everyone else wants to do. Am amazed at how **right on** everyone is. 

Am eternally grateful to Lirca for being my babblefish. I must send her lots of interesting chutneys later. But actaully everyone is being amazingly accomidating, and they take turns making sure I know what's going on. The communal meals are nice opportunities to talk and get to know the others in a relaxed setting. It's been awhile since I've been in an situation where I don't understand what's going on. I'm not as bothered about it as I used to be, even though I can tell I'm missing lots of jokes and will have stilted conversations. 

Have wonderful colloborators. Saulo studies limnology. Sabrina is a (radical?) writer. Aline is a recent graduate of architecture and a river project. We played the Wray Castle game in the other house. Sabrina won, but we got to see her play air trumpet so that's okay.

## Dia 2 - Segunda
We have a flipchart. Things were written on it. Have a vauge idea of creating a game around Serrinha, looking at the part/current/future through the medium of a text adventure game. Am facinated with the idea that what was once a coffee plantation is now a APA. There are people living here, which will stress the land. Water is not managed very well...

We have a list of people to talk to.
1. Felipe: Tuesday afternoon
2. Juçai factory
3. Trutas : Wed is public holiday...
4. Simonea & Donna Gloria AKA living libraries
5. Micro-brewery...
6. Meire : get number for juçai factory & living libraries
7. Local people from bar and camp site.
8. Saulo found a paper about Serrinha from 2008 and he will FB the undergraduate tomorrow.
9. Vegan chefs

Went for a walk to find Rio Pomo, thought we could find the source. Found some crazy hoses instead. Felipe says it's pretty out of control.
