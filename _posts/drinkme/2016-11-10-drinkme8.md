## Objective
Create a Text Adventure Game showing how human activity effects the local water eco-system of Serrinha. Research some facet of the environmental impact of the waterways for the game to create more understanding and empathy about the quality and quantity of the water supply. Provide an oblique documentation of the other projects during Interactivos?

## Por que | Why
Narratives are useful to explore big complicated abstract issues. Text adventure games significantly lowers the barrier to entry for players and creators of games. 

## Como : processo | How - the process
### 1. Pesquisa | Research
The best way to find out about a new place or thing is to rely on local knowledge. Find the places where communal activities happen, meet the people who are connectors to the community. (In our case Merie) Be open to listening to others.
#### Expedições | Field trips
SAULO WRITES HERE
Went out to visit several places of interest like Pedra Sonora, Trutarria, Agroforest...

#### Entrevista | Interviews
Meire told us about the Serrinha’s history and a lot of nice living libraries.  
    
Among them, we met seu Luís, who was really generous in teaching us about local species, what animal eats what, how the water levels vary and many other things. His veg patch is one of the only ones that is not attacked by jacus, because he feeds them corn along with his chicken. Vishwa, one of the Interactivos collaborators, told us about other animals that eat vegetables, fruits and roots from people’s backyards.   
  
This is the reason pointed by seu Luís to the small scale agriculture decrease after the APA foundation. Simone, d. Glória daughter, added that it happens because of the increase of vacation houses. They contract people to work as housekeepers, daily workers, etc.   
  
One of these young workers is José Luiz, who is employed in Trutas da Serrinha trouts. He studied to be environmental guide, and seems vacationed to be touristic guide. He told us a lot about wild life.  
  
D. Glória told us her history, which is tied to the one of this place. When she was 11, she lived in the camping, called island at the time, because they who were there could not get out after full rains. There were no bridge and the rivers flows were way fuller. She and her family were well adapted and thrived here. They worked with no labor rights, giving part of their production as a payment to the landlord. The large farm that existed here was divided and sold when a mandioca flour enterprise failed. They planted rice – part of an annual mutirão among local women – and beans, peanuts, mandioca, sweet potato, inhame.  
      
Seu Valdir, from Volta Redonda, is helping his cousin Alzira to organize her space conforming to the environmental Law. He created a tool to tear the earth named after the Tatu mammal. With it, he installed the pipes that come from a source up to her house with a floating system to avoid waste. Most attentive people here use it in their reservoirs. Hoses collecting excessive water then spiting it away is one of the regional problems.  
#### Workshops
Ran two workshops at the local school.

Aline to explain more about this process. Made maps and then stories...

### 2. Build Game
#### Map narrative
Create paper version of the story and paths using post-it notes. Had several iterations based on the week of research. This was done as a group activity, the stickon/off nature of the post-it notes is useful to adapt the stories and narratives when new information is added. Probably went through 5 or 6 passes of the passages & paths.

#### Write story
Split up between 'passages' areas of interest. Aline wrote THIS, Sabrina wrote THIS, Saulo researched wrote about the myth of Pedra Sonora, forming of APA, and the other Interactivos? projects. Hwa Young glued everything together. Sabrina's experience as a writer added to the poetic nature of the stories. She thought about sounds certain animals would make and added it to the text.

#### Design
Add illustration, decide visual style. Brought in Fernanda to create drawings to emphasis certain parts of the story.

## With What - tools used
### Software
- Twine
- WordProcessor
- Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere

## PLAY! and get Feedback
Use notebook to get comments on Saturday. Create typeform survey to get further feedback from the rest of the world.

## Next steps
Put game online, add to IFDB. 
More detailed documentation with links to other projects during Interactivos?, photos, videos...
Would like to add a Spanish version.
